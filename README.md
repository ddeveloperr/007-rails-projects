== README

Building a forum app that's going to use the ![CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) gem to restrict the resources and actions a given user is allowed to perform.

Cancancan is an authorization library for Ruby on Rails that restricts, not only the resources, but also the actions within the resources that users are allowed to access.

This simple forum app allows us to create and answer questions.

Regular users can edit and delete the questions/answers they've posted. Admin users CAN edit and delete all the posts!
